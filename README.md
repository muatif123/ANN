# Artificial Neural Network using Keras

The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks.
These neurons are known as nodes.

Keras is an open source deep learning framework for python. It has been developed by an artificial intelligence researcher at Google named Francois Chollet. Leading organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei and Uber are currently using Keras. This tutorial walks through the installation of Keras, basics of deep learning, Keras models, Keras layers, Keras modules and finally conclude with some real-time applications.
