# Artificial Neural Network using Tensorflow and Keras

The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks.
These neurons are known as nodes.

## About Tensorflow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and gives developers the ability to easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows with intuitive, high-level APIs for both beginners and experts to create machine learning models in numerous languages. Developers have the option to deploy models on a number of platforms such as on servers, in the cloud, on mobile and edge devices, in browsers, and on many other JavaScript platforms. This enables developers to go from model building and training to deployment much more easily.

Easy model building
Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.

Robust ML production anywhere
Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.

Powerful experimentation for research
A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.

## About Keras

Keras is an open source deep learning framework for python. It has been developed by an artificial intelligence researcher at Google named Francois Chollet. Leading organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei and Uber are currently using Keras. This tutorial walks through the installation of Keras, basics of deep learning, Keras models, Keras layers, Keras modules and finally conclude with some real-time applications.
